      <h2>Filipino Hospitality</h2>
      <p>Filipinos are known worldwide for their exceptional warmth and hospitality. The concept of "malasakit" (caring for others) is deeply ingrained in Filipino culture. Visitors are often treated like family, with locals going out of their way to ensure guests feel welcome and comfortable.</p>
      <p>The phrase "Bahala na" reflects the Filipino optimistic and resilient spirit - a belief that things will work out in the end. This positive outlook, combined with genuine friendliness, makes the Philippines one of the most welcoming destinations in the world.</p>

      <h2>Family & Community</h2>
      <p>Family is at the heart of Filipino culture. The concept of "kapwa" (shared identity) extends beyond immediate family to the broader community. Filipinos maintain strong bonds with extended family members and often prioritize family gatherings and celebrations.</p>
      <p>This deep sense of community is evident in the "bayanihan" spirit - a tradition of communal unity and cooperation where neighbors help each other, originally seen when entire communities would physically carry a house to a new location.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
      <h2>Religion & Spirituality</h2>
      <p>The Philippines is the largest Christian nation in Asia, with over 80% of the population being Roman Catholic. This religious heritage, brought by Spanish colonizers, has deeply influenced Filipino culture, from festivals to daily life.</p>
      <p>However, the Philippines also has significant Muslim populations in Mindanao and indigenous spiritual practices in various regions, creating a rich tapestry of religious diversity and tolerance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
      <h2>Language & Expression</h2>
      <p>With over 170 languages spoken across the archipelago, the Philippines showcases incredible linguistic diversity. Filipino (based on Tagalog) and English are the official languages, but regional languages like Cebuano, Ilocano, and Hiligaynon are widely spoken.</p>
      <p>Filipinos are known for their love of music, from traditional folk songs to modern OPM (Original Pilipino Music). Karaoke is a national pastime, reflecting the Filipino joy for singing and entertainment.</p>
